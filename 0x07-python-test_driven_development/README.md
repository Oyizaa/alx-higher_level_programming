TDD is a software development methodology that involves writing tests for a piece of functionality before writing the code to implement that capability. The concept is to first build tests that explain the behavior of the code you want to write, and then write the code to pass those tests.


Python is a well-known programming language for carrying out TDD. Here's a quick rundown of how Python could be used for TDD:

Select a testing framework: Python has numerous testing frameworks, such as unittest, pytest, and nose. Choose the best one for your needs and learn how to utilize it.

Create a test: Create a test that explains the desired behavior of your code. For instance, if you're building a function that adds
The goal is to develop tests that describe the behavior of the code you want to two numbers, such as whether the function returns the proper output for a specific set of inputs.

Execute the test: Execute the test to determine if it fails. This is significant because it assures that the exam is testing what you believe it is testing.

Create the following code: Create the code that will allow the test to pass. In our case, you'd create a function that adds two numbers.
