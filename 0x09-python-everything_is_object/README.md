0x09 Python â€“ Everything is an object Description This project centers on the object-oriented programming concept in Python. It discusses objects, classes, instances, immutable and mutable objects, references, assignments, aliases, and variable IDs, among other things. The project also contains questions about Python's uniqueness as well as the distinction between immutable and mutable types.

Requirements The following tools are permitted: vi, vim, and emacs. All files were interpreted/compiled with python3 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. (version 3.8.5) All folders should be terminated with a new line. The first sentence of each file should be #!/usr/bin/python3. A README.md file at the base of the project folder is required. The pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) should be used in the code. Every program must be executable. wc will be used to determine the length of your folders.
Every program must be executable. wc will be used to determine the length of your folders. Project Assignments Task 0: Respond to queries about Python's uniqueness. Task 1: Create a function that gives an object's id. Task 2: What will the outcome of this code be? Task 3: Write a function that gives the JSON representation of an object (string) Task 4: What will the outcome of this code be? Task 5: Create a function that yields a Python object (data structure) represented by a JSON string. Task 6: What will the outcome of this code be? Task 7: Create a function that gives a list's duplicate. Task 8: Given the preceding information, what does the following code print? Task 9: Respond to inquiries about what Zen entails. Objectives of Learning Why is Python computing awesome? What exactly is an object? What exactly is the distinction between a class and an object or instance? What is the distinction between a fixed object and a mutable object? What exactly is a reference? What exactly is an assignment? What exactly is an alias? How can I tell if two factors are the same? How to determine whether two variables are connected to the same object How to show the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation) What is the difference between changeable and immutable? What are the available changeable types? What are the immutable types that are embedded in? Python's variable passing to methods 9.10 Objects and Resources
